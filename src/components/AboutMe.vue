      I'm a <span class="text-red-500">Frontend Developer</span> with a strong <span class="text-red-500">UI/UX</span> design foundation, expert at bridging the gap between aesthetic vision and technical reality. Leveraging tools like Figma and Photoshop alongside React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, I build responsive, accessible, and high-performing web experiences. I specialize in turning user-centered designs into robust, scalable interfaces from concept to deployment. I enjoy learning new technologies, solving problems creatively, and collaborating on projects that push me to grow.
